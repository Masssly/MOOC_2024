<h2>About this course</h2>
<p>Wikidata is emerging as a pivotal hub in the web of data. It contains more than 110 million Items and is currently the most active of all the Wikimedia projects. However, for beginners, understanding how to contribute to Wikidata can be challenging. This course guides learners through 5 chapters, exploring the knowledgebase, queries, open data, and the semantic web. You'll gain insight into Wikidata's operations and foundational principles before diving into making your first contributions.</p>
  
<p>You will learn how to create new Items on Wikidata, determine which topics are allowed on Wikidata, and understand the measures taken to ensure data quality. Additionally, you'll explore how to reuse data from Wikidata and engage with a community of several thousand volunteers.</p>
  
<p>The first edition of this English version of the MOOC took place in April 2024. Learn more about the course description, content and schedule for future iterations at <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata_talk:Open_Online_Course">Wikidata:Open Online Course.</a></p>
